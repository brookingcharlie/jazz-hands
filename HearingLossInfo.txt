So, at the meetup some peeps asked: How many deaf people are in Australia.
Good question!

Here is some stats along with some personal annecdotes regarding hearing loss:

It is estimated that 1 in 6 people in Australia suffer from a hearing loss.

It is definately a fuzzy problem to try to quantify how many people are affected.

"By example, a lecturer with mild hearing loss may experience severe hearing 
handicap simply trying to interact with students in a lecture theatre 
â€“ hearing loss reduces their capacity to work and relate effectively..... 

By contrast, a metal worker with advanced hearing loss living alone may 
experience little hearing handicap if he has few difficult communicative interactions."

Holding a conversation with one person is a much easier challenge for me
that attempting to follow movie dialogue.
Some of the reasons being:
-Rapid multiple speakers
-Sound affects
-Inability to ask the speaker to slow down or repeat themselves

For this reason, I think that there are actually quite a few people 
with hearing difficulties that are reluctant to publicly advocate for 
solutions. I know of at least one person who does not wear hearing
aid due to stigmatic reasons.
